This script reads the xliff file that is in the same folder as the .py and downloads images that are linked between <screenshot> tags.

When you double click the .py file, it creates a folder called "screenshots" and downloads all the images from hyperlinks in the .xliff.

If there aren't any hyperlinks or any xliff files, the script will not do anything.
